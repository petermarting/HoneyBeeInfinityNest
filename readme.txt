Welcome to the Honey Bee Infinity Nest Data Repository

This is a repository for the data associated with an experiment to test the within-cavity nest initiation locations of honey bees. 

There are three dataframes: 
1) nest_df contains data that summarizes the whole nest measurements for colonies in the experiment.
2) comb_df contains data on the individual combs for each colony in the experiment (some colonies built more than 1 comb). A preliminary round of experiments ("round 1") is included in this dataframe to compare the aspect ratio of combs attached to the wall and the ceiling (see manuscript figure 4B for more details). 
3) waxdeposit_df contains data on the area of was deposit sprawling inside the cavity.
